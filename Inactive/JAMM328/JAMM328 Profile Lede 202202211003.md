# Lede

Dr. Andy Hudak's education lead him to study forest fires. They change our ecosystem. His work is to help understand this part of the climate change puzzle.

On a cold rainy February morning he arrived for his interview on his bicycle! He was between work trips studying controlled forest fires, last week in Florida and in 2 weeks he's headed to Georgia.
