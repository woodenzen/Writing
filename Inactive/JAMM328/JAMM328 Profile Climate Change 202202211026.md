# Climate Change

Many of his coauthors are University of Idaho and Washington State University scientists and postdoctoral students.

Hudak's studies the interplay between fire and the forest by quantifying the carbon balance between the forest and what a fire puts into the air. Forest fires take carbon out of the forest and put it in the air contributing to climate change. 

> "Climate change is such an overreaching issue for everything we do. It's hard to think of something we do that doesn't have at least some implication for climate change." said Hudak

Forest managers use the information in Hudak's studies to make decisions. Decisions about where to use prescribed fires. Decisions about how to fight wild fires.

"We really need more prescribed fire in the West. We can look to the Southeast as a good example of how they use prescribed… maintenance fires in the understory." said Hudak.
