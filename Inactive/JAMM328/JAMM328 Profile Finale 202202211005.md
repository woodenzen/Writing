# Finale

"I loved watching birds. I wanted to go into ornithology, or so I thought."

"Still have trouble say no to learning new things." said Hudak. Though he gets freedom to work on whatever piques my interest. He gets the freedom to choose who he collaborates with. "I love my job for that reason."

Indulging in his second research passion his systems level skill apply to how bird habit characterized. He can't say no to participating in any study that furthers understanding of individual species or whole avian diversity for a given site. 
 
Success in publishing the results from his field work has pushed Hudak out of the field and more into team management. "I have less time to do my own analysis now. I do a lot more project management, so I'm in a lot more meeting, I often running the meeting." (47)

"How findings my are used is much harder to control, which has easy potential for frustration, so maybe that's why I (and many other scientists) don't focus on that much."

Swapping the hard hat and work boots for comfortable office attire. 

At the end of the interview, Andy announces that he'll take advantage of the break in the rain. Dawning his bike helmet, pant leg clips, and his rain jacket, he waves as he heads for his office on his bicycle. Doing his part to reduce carbon emissions.
