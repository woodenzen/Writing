Dark, dark, dark.
"The West of which I speak is but another name for the Wild; and what I have been preparing to say is, that in Wildness is the preservation of the World." – Henry David Thoreau 
After a strenuous twelve-mile hike deep in Hells Canyon to one of the dependable water sources high on the canyon walls, I set up a simple tarp camp at 4700 feet near the spring close to the intersection of the High Trail and the Hat Point Trail at the head of Smooth Hollow.
The primal feeling of the wild is deeply rooted in being human. I found this wildness in a place filled with peaceful sounds, many scents, and endlessly felt sensations for which no words exist. The quality of the sunlight, the delicate smells of the wildflowers, and the musk of the many elk are evidence of springtime in the air.

Not sure what time it is, but it is dark, dark, dark. The nearness of the howling and yelping has shot my body full of adrenaline. My primal instinctual hackles are at DEFCON 1, and I'm fully alert. I'm standing by my sleeping bag, searching for anything to put in my hands that might provide a sense of security. My eyes scan the darkness for any signs of movement. Twenty seconds and it is over even before I can register what is happening. There is a slight rustling in the undergrowth, and then the night returns to being dark, dark, dark. As quickly as they had come, they left. I am of no interest to them other than as something to be avoided.
These ghosts in the night are the descendants of a black-furred gray wolf whose wanderlust led him to swim across the Snake River from the Idaho side to the Oregon side of Hells Canyon. 
"Welcome back to the wild," the darkness whispers to me, "you are home." At that moment, I felt completely at ease in the silence of the dark, dark, dark. Fleeing is not an option. I can die here, and this would not be the worst fate that could befall me.
