> The Africa in my dreams and the Africa I remember, now that I have been there, come together and diverge to form crisscrossing patterns of texture and color, light and shadow, like a haunting abstract work of art that dominates corners of the imagination, a tapestry weaving itself out of what is real and what is pure imagination, a tapestry whose colors and cultures collide and overlap, changing from country to country, religion to religion, from place to place and village to village.  
> Eddy l. Harris, "Native Stranger" 

My argument is an idea that you may think of as arrogant coming from a white middle-class American. Racism and elitism lie on a spectrum from the pure, saintly, and altruistic on one end to the hellion white supremacist skinhead and the arrogant, privileged tourist on the other end of the spectrum. We move up and down the range, taking up different positions in different situations. Before one tries to understand Eddy Harris's position and how he questioned his place on the spectrum, one should check where one is currently on this spectrum. Racism and elitism are learned and reinforced through dysfunctional societal mechanisms. 

Harris acknowledges the complexity of his racism and elitism while simultaneously exposing the historical racism and colonialism Africans have suffered and continue to suffer mightily. He acknowledges that at the end of his travels in Africa, given his experiences, he would not want to live in Africa. He sees a tiny benefit to himself because his ancestors were traded as enslaved people. In his eyes, slavery got his genes away from Africa and into America, which gives him the opportunities he enjoys [@harris:1994 299-300]. This paper will examine how scenes of racial tension and elitism play out, working in a way that holds Harris back from his goal of discovering who he is.
Harris becomes more human by admitting racial and elitist confusion, biases, and stereotypes [@harris:1994 33]. Specifically, I'll demonstrate how Harris explores and ultimately exposes the slipperiness of a modern Black American's confrontation with racism, and I'll argue the post-colonial squaller that Harris confronts in Western Africa triggers his elitism coloring his vision of his project to discover who he is.

The *Native* in Harris's title is paradoxical and shows his desire to be considered a part of the Black African homeland. To be considered native is to be part of his historical heritage. He starts off the book with, "In the mind and perhaps dreams of every person with black skin, the specter of Africa looms like the shadow of a genie, dormant but not altogether harmless, always there, heard about since childhood as some magnificent faraway world, a place of magic and wonder. Africa as motherland"
[@harris:1994 13]. Harris acknowledges he doesn't feel African and worries that he might hate the place. "Only in traveling there could I discover the truth" [@harris:1994 14].

The *Stranger* in Harris's title is also paradoxical. It shows his fear and reluctance to be included as an African. He remains estranged from commitment and maintains a traveler's aloofness throughout his journey, sticking close to his passport, always knowing he'd return to America when his journey ended. The goals of travel have meanings and agendas often hidden even from the traveler. Ultimately, where ever one goes, there you are. The places you visit are changed "no matter how unobtrusive your passing… your footprints are wide and deep[@harris:1994 72]. As Harris sets off on his adventure, he is afraid of what he might find out about his true self. 

> "Africa could teach me about life and what it means to be human, deepen my appreciation for all that I am and all that I have, help me to find, perhaps, the face of God, perhaps even my own face, help me to step out of my cozy little world, out of myself so that I could see myself better and better define myself" [@harris:1994 27].  

In the above passage, Harris narrates his goals for his project, but perhaps he is putting too much stock in going to Africa part and not enough in finding what it means to be a human part which Henry David Thoreau would argue doesn't require traveling to Africa. Thoreau was not a world traveler. He questioned the motives of the traveler who venture off on some "rare sport" like hunting giraffes. He thought a traveler would find more of what "he would be after," by focusing on the local environment and quietly journaling his experience. 

> One hastens to Southern Africa to chase the giraffe; but surely that is not the game he would be after. How long, pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he could? Snipes and woodcocks also may afford rare sport; but I trust it would be nobler game to shoot one’s self [@thoreau:2004 337].

★★★★    
The book's first words foreshadow his failure to find any resolution to his search to work out who he is. He is cosmopolitan, part of the human race, and doesn't see himself confined to the African race, even in the color of his skin. He realizes that his birth was the gift of a lottery, and he could have born a baby girl in Mali, destined to die by age 5 of malnutrition or poor hygiene, or dehydration [@harris:1994 140]. 
 
> "Because my skin is black, you will say I traveled Africa to find the roots of my race. I did not — unless that race is the human race, for except in the color of my skin, I am not African. If I didn’t know it then, I know it now. I am a product of the culture that raised me" [@harris:1994 13].

Comparing his African travels with his cultural upbringing, Harris's experiences in Africa are one disaster after another. The bugs,  malaria, rotten food, unsafe and unappealing water, poor hygiene, dilapidated river ferries, beggars, non-working phones and toilets, the apathy of the locals, the bureaucratic apathy, his short stint in jail, and poor transportation infrastructure make this an endurance test. Yet he can't forget Mbaye's last words to Harris when they part in Paris, "When you write about them, be honest and try to do justice to them" [@harris:1994 22]. And yet, he endures the horrors and miseries of the politically and socially impoverished Africa in search of who he is.

American exceptionalism is all around him. At one moment, he hates Africa and what it stands for, and at the next, he acts possessively. Harris wants all the "holiday adventurers" to go home. The "holiday adventures" "do not seem aware of the damage" they cause. Harris sees this whole constellation of "natives" and "strangers" as a "pain that shatters my heart." Then he turns to himself and notices he also is on a sort of holiday adventure [@harris:1994 214]. 

Harris sees the two-way indignity of the bribery system as an affront to his American exceptionalism. He knows he is expected to pay bribery, but his "stubbornness and pride" and a "sense of right and wrong" gets in his way. The military and police officers are so poorly paid that this is the way they survive. They will even bargain for bribes [@harris:1994 278].

We can't judge African society by the standards of modernity, as Africa has been held back from the fruits of modernity. Most of Africa struggles for survival and can't be concerned with the issues of modernity. Human flourishing and suffering are measures of values of right and wrong. Africa gets some things right and a lot wrong. The West gets some things right and a lot wrong. We need to work as humans to be less wrong [@harris:1994 278]. 

"I wonder: If an African came to America, would he be afraid to drink the water? Would his system be shocked by the sudden absence of microbes in the food and water? Would he get sick [@harris:1994 295]?" Would he be afraid of riding in a bus or train? Would he expect to be cheated at the store? Would he be disappointed with the supermarket's selection and freshness of the produce? Would he be surprised by a working shower? Would he have to bribe every government official? Would he fear the police?  

★★★★    

Harris slips into Liberia through a border crossing that the locals regularly use, and the guards have no experience with foreign travelers. He is questioned, and he is treated like a potential spy [@harris:1994 241]. Arrested and sent to a military base in another town. Eventually, he is treated as a "privileged prisoner" because of his American passport, affording him special treatment. But he still suffers the indignities of being "allowed to sleep on the concrete floor in the security office." Unlike all the other prisoners, he was able to "send out for cold drinks and food." They give him the privilege to "use the bathroom—which was broken." [@harris:1994 260] 

What stands in the way of Harris reaching any sense of closure to his project of self-inquisition is that Harris can't let go of his identity as an American. His identity as an American is such an essential part of his inner life that he can't relax into what Africa can teach him about his true self. Harris questions his views on racism and elitism, in Nicklas Hållén's terms, he begins to realize his project "of stepping out of himself, ridding himself of the past, or shedding the skin of his old self" [@hallen:2018a 374] is a smaller project than discovering his humanness. When Harris recognizes his failure at his project of discovering who he is, he begins to see who he is in relationship to his humanness. His reiteration of the failure this project had, in the end, working out who he is, is a sign of a beginning of looking at a past that he "must live with and a present he must live in" [@hallen:2018a 376]. The color of Harris's skin defines him, and it identifies him with the outside world even though his internal persona is different from what everyone else sees [@harris:1994 35]. He writes in South Africa, with a full belly, "Love and hate do not come from the color of your skin, but from what you care inside... But, it could be such a beautiful world if we could defy the darker sides of our nature" [@harris:1994 314]. 

★★★★    
"It was the end of Africa for me," Harris writes. In Zaire, on the riverboat *Major Mudimbi*, Harris gets lectured by the captain, telling him to move to Africa because he represents "the most advanced black man in the world [a]s an American black man. We need you. This is your home. This is where you belong" to "help [t]his country grow." Harris's response:  

> I was shaking my head. I could never live in Africa. I told him. I had been here too long already.  
> "You prefer to live with the whites?" he said. He pointed his thumb at Justin. "His ancestors stole your ancestors from this place and took them to America as slaves. How can you live with them?"  
> Thinking quickly back on all I had seen and all I had felt, I turned to Justin and thanked him. The spell was broken [@harris:1994 299-300]. 

I contend that racism and American exceptionalism profoundly influenced Eddy Harris's conception of his relationship with Africa and led him to frame his identity, not because of the color of his skin but the humanness of his heart. Harris goes to Africa, failing to discover what it means to be the person he is. "This failure is the price that Harris pays to access the full complexity of selfhood,"[@hallen:2018a 363]. Harris searches for answers with a curious mind and finds the stereotypes of African life more complicated and fragile than he expected. This puts him in a position where he experiences contradictions realizing that he is less of a *native* and more of a *stranger*. In Africa, he never gets to discover what it means to be the person he is. He discovers he is comfortable and at home as part of the African diaspora and human collective. It should be clear now that Harris will never be a *native* but always consider himself a *stranger* in the African homeland.
