[kjhealy/pandoc-templates: Some templates for Pandoc.](https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates)

command for symlink that works!
`ln -s "/Users/will/Dropbox/zettelkasten/Zoomorphism 202103122057.md" "/Users/will/Dropbox/Projects/Writing/Build/Zoomorphism 202103122057.md"`
Now I have to figure out a way to get the TEMPLATE.sh script to auto create it. THe hard part will be getting the timestamp.
I could start the script from within The Archive and then I'd have the title, timestamp, and the most importantly the file would exist.
