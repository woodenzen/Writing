#definition 
"Ambient" refers to the surrounding environment or atmosphere of a place, particularly its sensory qualities like sound, light, or temperature that envelop individuals within that space. The root of "ambient" comes from the Latin "ambiens," which means "going around," and is derived from "ambire" (to go around).

## Heavy Hitters
GPT
B.F. Skinner and Environmental Determinism: Skinner, a titan in the field of psychology, could be your starting pitcher. His work on behaviorism and environmental determinism underscores the idea that our behaviors, and by extension, our feelings and emotional responses, are significantly shaped by our immediate environment. Skinner's theories provide a sturdy scaffold for arguing that ambient conditions can influence emotional states like love.

Ulrich Neisser and Cognitive Psychology: Neisser, a pioneering figure in cognitive psychology, could help bolster your argument from a cognitive perspective. His work emphasizes the importance of the environment in shaping perception and cognition. By extension, this could support the idea that ambient conditions affect our cognitive processes related to emotions, including love.

Gaston Bachelard and The Poetics of Space: Bachelard isn't just a heavy hitter; he's the Babe Ruth of philosophizing about spaces. In "The Poetics of Space," he delves into how different spaces evoke different emotional responses. This book is a goldmine for arguing that the ambiance of a space can profoundly affect feelings, including love. Bachelard's poetic approach to spatial analysis could help you argue that "ambient love" isn't just a fancy term but a deeply rooted psychological phenomenon.

----------------------------------
>> It's a neat idea, but you're treating it like a freshly discovered philosophical stone without giving us a concrete reason to care. You need to ground this idea with more than just a fancy term. Love as a concept is complex, dynamic, and deeply personal. Turning it into background noise diminishes its significance. How does it manifest? Can you give examples? Make it tangible. Build bridges between them. How does the ambiance of a space directly influence feelings of love? Is "ambient love" a byproduct of design, or is it something more? Bring in some heavy hitters from psychology or philosophy to back up your claims.

> ZCA - the concept of "ambient" within the context of environmental aesthetics, the phenomenology of space, and its impact on human perception and emotion. Include references or key studies that support the psychological and emotional impacts of the ambient environments mentioned—an intriguing extension of the concept. The Zettel could benefit from a brief mention of key theorists or studies that support these claims, enhancing its utility for future research or exploration.

I want to pair two terms not usually used together—ambient love. For our purposes, "ambient love" refers to an environment imbued with the essence of love, creating an atmosphere of affection and connection without the need for direct interaction or even conscious recognition.

Ambient is a word most people associate with background music.[^1] Instead, it is a philosophical skyscraper. It is what attracts us to each other—created in the space where two people meet and connect. This ambient love might be in the environment, or you may bring it with you. It is the fuel that lights the fire of love.  

Building a bridge to ambient love. 

Examples:
1. Infant brought home to a 'nursery' which is a made space with an intentional ambiance of love. 
2. Any rite of passage—graduation, marriage, funeral 
3. Dating

    - Try giving examples or expanding on how this unnoticed presence affects us for a stronger punch.

    - If you're trying to emphasize the pre-existence of ambient conditions, consider providing a deeper dive into the implications of this pre-existence instead of just restating the fact.
- Things that are ambient. are outside of time.
    - How are ambient things outside of time? Are you suggesting they're immutable, constant, or that they exist in a perpetual 'now'?

- There is a difference between found ambience and created ambience. 
    - Is the found ambiance stumbled upon a naturally perfect acoustic in a cave, while the created ambiance is someone meticulously designing a concert hall? Flesh this out.
