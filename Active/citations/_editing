# Editing Checklist

#writing-tip #outline 
Super outlining tip that I need to try.
 > The only effective outline is to be a list of full assertions—one for each paragraph. Each must assert something definite, not just point in a general direction. Then the progression of assertions must make sense and say something so you can finally force that list of assertions into a single assertion that really says something.”

Developing and maintaining a sense of urgency—the feeling that we *have* to keep reading—is critical to most writing.

☐ Search for these words and phrases to do a quick check:“there are,” “it is,” “its,” “it’s,” “your,” “you’re,” “their,” and “they’re.”

☐ Wrong Wordaffect/effect, lay/lie, sit/set, who/whom, toward/towards, etc.☐ Vague Pronoun ReferenceConfusing: Bob annoyed Larry, but that didn’t stop him from asking for a meeting.Clear: Bob annoyed Larry, but that didn’t stop Larry from asking for a meeting.☐ Lack of Pronoun-Antecedent AgreementFrequently Disparaged: Everyone withdrew their money.Uncontroversial: Everyone withdrew his or her money.Uncontroversial: People withdrew their money.☐ Missing or Unnecessary CapitalizationCapitalize proper nouns: Capitalize the names of things, such as “the Golden Gate Bridge.”Lowercase common nouns: Lowercase descriptions, such as “that famous bridge.”☐ Unnecessary Shift in Verb TenseWrong: John Wilkes Booth barricaded the door while Lincoln is watching the play.Right: John Wilkes Booth barricaded the door while Lincoln watched the play.☐ Sentence FragmentsSentence fragments aren’t always wrong, but don’t use them accidentally.Fragments: Because she was late. And I held the door.- How Big Is A Thought? [[202107111234]]☐ Monotonous Sentence StructureMonotonous: We were late. I called the office. Bob answered the phone. Bob told Sue. Sue stalled the investors.Better: I called the office because we were late. Bob answered the phone and told Sue, who stalled the investors.☐ Adjective DriftConfusing: The property has seasonal creeks and trail access.Clear: The property has trail access and seasonal creeks.’☐ Unnecessary Adverbs and PrepositionsBloated: I was very angry that Bob sat down on the wet paint.Better: I was furious that Bob sat on the wet paint.- Vary Sentence Subjects [[202306102044]]
     * Playing with your sentence subjects and placing them in different positions in a sentence avoids repetition.
☐ Parallelism Errors §[[202203310809]] Not Parallel: Kids like singing, chatting, and check their phones.Parallel: Kids like singing, chatting, and checking their phones.☐ Passive VoicePassive voice isn’t wrong, but active sentences are often better.Passive: The bell was rung by zombies.Active: Zombies rang the bell.☐ “There Are” SentencesYou can often improve sentences that start with “There are.”Not great: There are usually 54 cards in a deck.Better: A deck usually has 54 cards.☐ JargonJargon: You can often improve on expletive sentences.More Accessible: You can often improve on sentences that start with “There are.”☐ Missing Comma After Introductory ElementWrong: In the past we bought vinyl records.Right: In the past, we bought vinyl records.☐ Unnecessary CommaWrong: Bob likes pandas, and visits the zoo often.Right: Bob likes pandas and visits the zoo often.☐ Comma SpliceWrong: I ate cake, I played games.Right: I ate cake, and I played games.Right: I ate cake and played games.☐ Run-On SentencesWrong: I ate cake I played games.Right: I ate cake, and I played games.Right: I ate cake and played games.☐ Missing Comma in a Compound Sentence Wrong: All my friends came over for my birthday Tuesday and Bobby visited me the next day.Right: All my friends came over for my birthday Tuesday, and Bobby visited me the next day.

- Visual And Syntax Balance [[202012281430]]☐ Missing Comma with a Nonrestrictive ElementWrong: Shoes which are worn on your feet come in many styles.Right: Shoes, which are worn on your feet, come in many styles.☐ Mechanical Problems with QuotationsIn the U.S., periods and commas go inside the closing quotation mark. Semicolons, colons, and dashes go outside theclosing quotation mark. The position of question marks and exclamation points varies: They stay with their question orexclamation.Correct:She yelled, “Help!”I won a copy of “Wrecking Ball”!She asked, “Are you hungry?”Did he just say, “We in Hungary”?☐ Quotation Marks for EmphasisWrong: “Free” soda on Saturdays.Right: Free soda on Saturdays.☐ Apostrophe ErrorsNouns take apostrophes to become possessive. Pronouns don’t. “It’s” means “it is” or “it has.” “Its” is the possessive formof “it.” Acronyms, initialisms, and years don’t take apostrophes to become plural (CDs, 1980s).☐ Unnecessary or Missing HyphenDon’t hyphenate phrasal verbs.Wrong: Log-in to your account.Right: Log in to your account.Do hyphenate compound adjectives. These mean different things: “small car salesman” and “small-car salesman.”☐ Spelling ErrorsRemember to run a spellcheck. It’s obvious but easy to forget.----------------------------------------------------------------
